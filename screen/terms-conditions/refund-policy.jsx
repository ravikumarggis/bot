        <h3 className="font-medium mt-3">1.1 Subscription Services</h3>
        <p className="opacity-90">
          Users may cancel their subscription (Starter, Pro, or any other plan) at any time from their account settings.
          Cancellation will take effect at the end of the current billing cycle ‚Äî meaning access remains active until the period expires.
          No prorated refunds are issued for partial months, unused features, or early cancellations.
        </p>

        <h3 className="font-medium mt-3">1.2 One-Week Free Trial</h3>

        </p>

        <h3 className="font-medium mt-3">1.3 One-Time Purchases / Credits</h3>
