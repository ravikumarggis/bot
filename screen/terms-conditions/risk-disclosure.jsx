        <p className="mt-4 opacity-90">
          This General Risk Disclosure ("Risk Disclosure") applies to your use of the QIE Bots website, its platform, features, and any related products or services (collectively referred to as the "Services"). QIE Bots ("we," "our," or "us") refers to the domain <a className="text-indigo-600 underline" href="https://qiebots.com/">https://qiebots.com/</a> ("Platform"). By accessing or using QIE Bots, you acknowledge, understand, and accept the risks described below.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">1. No Financial Advice or Investment Recommendations</h2>
        <p className="opacity-90">
          QIE Bots is not a licensed financial advisor, broker, or exchange. The tools and information provided through our platform do not constitute financial, investment, or trading advice. Our platform enables automated trading through strategies such as Grid, Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA), and AI-powered bots, but these tools should not be interpreted as recommendations to buy, sell, or hold any digital asset. All trading decisions are made at your sole discretion — consult a qualified financial professional before trading.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">2. Informational and Educational Purposes Only</h2>
        <p className="opacity-90">
          Charts, data, performance analytics, and strategy information on QIE Bots are provided for educational and informational purposes only. While we strive for accuracy, we do not guarantee the completeness or reliability of any data or analysis shown on the Platform. Do not rely solely on QIE Bots for investment decisions — perform your own research and due diligence.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">3. Cryptocurrency Market Risks</h2>
        <p className="opacity-90">
          Trading and investing in cryptocurrencies involves a high degree of risk due to extreme market volatility, liquidity constraints, and unpredictable price movements. Prices can move rapidly and result in significant financial loss. Past performance is not indicative of future results — only invest funds you can afford to lose.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">4. Regulatory and Legal Risks</h2>
        <p className="opacity-90">
          Cryptocurrency regulation varies by jurisdiction and may change frequently. Changes in law, tax policy, or regulatory interpretation may affect your ability to trade, hold, or transfer digital assets. You are responsible for complying with local laws and tax obligations. QIE Bots does not provide legal or tax advice.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">5. Technical and Security Risks</h2>
        <p className="opacity-90">
          Using automated trading systems and digital assets carries technical risks, including cybersecurity threats (hacking, phishing), software vulnerabilities, exchange disruptions (downtime, latency), and network issues (internet or blockchain congestion). Secure your account with strong passwords, two-factor authentication (2FA), and keep API keys private. QIE Bots is not liable for losses from compromised credentials or insecure user practices.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">6. Trading Execution and Liquidity Risks</h2>
        <p className="opacity-90">
          Markets can suffer low liquidity, slippage, and execution delays that may impact bot performance. Orders rely on connected exchanges and are not guaranteed to execute at a requested price or time. Monitor your bots and trading pairs regularly to manage execution risk.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">7. Platform Availability and System Risks</h2>
        <p className="opacity-90">
          While QIE Bots aims for reliable service, uptime cannot be guaranteed. Scheduled maintenance, unexpected outages, or connectivity issues between the Platform and exchanges may interrupt trading or data updates. QIE Bots is not responsible for losses resulting from downtime or exchange unavailability.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">8. User Responsibility and Due Diligence</h2>
        <p className="opacity-90">
          Users are responsible for setting up, configuring, and operating their trading bots. Ensure you understand deployed strategies and the risks involved. QIE Bots provides automation tools — not guaranteed profit systems. Perform independent research before enabling any strategy.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">9. Third-Party Services and Integrations</h2>
        <p className="opacity-90">
          QIE Bots connects to third-party exchanges via APIs for order execution. We do not control exchange uptime, liquidity, or API behavior. You are bound by third-party exchange terms, and QIE Bots is not liable for inaccuracies or delays caused by external services.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">10. Non-Custodial and User Liability</h2>
        <p className="opacity-90">
          QIE Bots is non-custodial — your funds remain with your connected exchange and we never request withdrawal permissions. However, bot actions are executed using your configured parameters; misconfiguration can cause unexpected results. You accept responsibility for monitoring and managing your automation. QIE Bots is not liable for direct or consequential losses from platform use.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
